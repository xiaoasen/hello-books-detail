# 5.1.5 Instruction Summary
A controller instruction in our register-machine language has one of the following forms, where each ⟨${input_i}$⟩ is either `(reg ⟨register-name⟩)` or `(const ⟨constant-value⟩)`. These instructions were introduced in [5.1.1]:

```
(assign ⟨register-name⟩ (reg ⟨register-name⟩))
(assign ⟨register-name⟩ 
        (const ⟨constant-value⟩))
(assign ⟨register-name⟩ 
        (op ⟨operation-name⟩) 
        ⟨input₁⟩ … ⟨inputₙ⟩)
(perform (op ⟨operation-name⟩) 
         ⟨input₁⟩ 
         … 
         ⟨inputₙ⟩)
(test (op ⟨operation-name⟩) 
      ⟨input₁⟩ 
      … 
      ⟨inputₙ⟩)
(branch (label ⟨label-name⟩))
(goto (label ⟨label-name⟩))
```

The use of registers to hold labels was introduced in [5.1.3]:

```
(assign ⟨register-name⟩ (label ⟨label-name⟩))
(goto (reg ⟨register-name⟩))
```

Instructions to use the stack were introduced in [5.1.4]:

```
(save ⟨register-name⟩)
(restore ⟨register-name⟩)
```

The only kind of ⟨constant-value⟩ we have seen so far is a number, but later we will use strings, symbols, and lists. For example,`(const "abc")` is the string `"abc"`,`(const abc)` is the symbol `abc`,`(const (a b c))` is the list `(a b c)`,and `(const ())` is the empty list.
